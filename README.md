# hockey-teams-data-scraper
A program that automatically scrapes a webpage with data about Ice Hockey teams, extracts
these data from the table, 
searches the page for links that will also lead to subsequent pages with similar data, visits those links and also extracts the data from the tables
and finally saves the extracted data in a csv file.
